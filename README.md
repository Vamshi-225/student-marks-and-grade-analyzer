🎓 Student Marks and Grade Analyzer

A simple and modular Python project designed to analyze and manage student performance data.
This program calculates total marks, averages, and grades for multiple students based on their subject-wise scores.

📘 Project Overview

The Student Marks and Grade Analyzer provides a basic system to store, process, and evaluate student marks efficiently.
It demonstrates how to use functions, lists, and dictionaries in Python for real-world data management.

This project is ideal for beginners learning Python, focusing on concepts like data structures, loops, and conditionals.

⚙️ Features

🧾 Store student names, IDs, and marks for multiple subjects.
📊 Calculate total and average marks for each student.
🏅 Assign grades based on total performance.
🔁 Structured using modular functions for better readability and reusability.

🧠 Concepts Used

Python Functions and Return Statements.
Lists and Dictionaries (including nested dictionaries).
If-Elif-Else conditional statements.
Looping and Data Access in structured datasets.

🚀 How It Works

The program defines functions to store student data, subjects, and marks.
It calculates total and average marks for each student.
Based on total marks, it assigns grades (A, B, C, D, E, or Fail).
Results can be printed or extended to include more features like rank generation or visualization.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Add data visualization using Matplotlib or Seaborn
Include student ranking and report card generation
Integrate with CSV or database (e.g., SQLite / PostgreSQL) for persistent storage
